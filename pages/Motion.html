        <h1 class="main-title">Motion</h1>
        <p class="IntroductionText">Motion is the change in position of an object over time. It can be described in terms of displacement, distance, speed, velocity, and acceleration. Understanding motion is fundamental to the study of physics as it helps explain how objects interact with forces and energy.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Key Concepts in Motion</h2>
        <ul class="key-concepts">
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the change in position of an object. It has both magnitude and direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> A scalar quantity that refers to how much ground an object has covered during its motion.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> A scalar quantity that refers to how fast an object is moving. It is calculated as distance divided by time (s = d/t).</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object changes its position. It is calculated as displacement divided by time (v = Δx/Δt).</li>
            <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. It is calculated as change in velocity divided by time (a = Δv/Δt).<br><br></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="section-title">Interpreting displacement-time, velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs</h2>

        <video src="..\assets\S_Tgraphs.mp4" class="animations" autoplay loop muted></video>
        
        <p class="explanation">
            As you can see, when displacement is increasing at a constant rate, where displacement is directly proportional to time, the velocity is constant.
            <br><br>
            This shows that obtaining the velocity graph from a displacement graph is just <b>diffrentiating</b> the function used to graph displacement
            <br><br>
            Just in case it is not clear yet,<br>lets suppose this is the equation for displacement:
            
            \[
            s  =  10t
            \]
            \[ 
            \frac {ds} {dt}  =  \frac {ds} {dt} \cdot (10t)
            \] 
            \[ 
            \frac {ds} {dt} \cdot (10t)  =  10
            \]
            \[
            \frac {ds} {dt}  =  v
            \]
            <p class="explanation">
                Thus:
            </p>
            \[
            v  =  10
            \]

            This example shows a parabolic s - t graph.<br><br>If we apply the same logic to this situation, we obtain a linear graph;
            this makes sense as our gradient (which represents the velocity at that point) is increasing at a linear rate, 
            which also means our velocity is increasing linearly.

            Velocity time graphs
            <br><br>
        </h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            Velocity - time graphs have velocity on the <b>y - axis</b> and time on the <b>x - axis</b>. In this situation, the gradient 
            of the graph at a point <b>represents the acceleration</b> of the object. 
            <br><br>
            The <b>Area</b> under the graph until a certain point represents the <b>distance</b> that object moves.
            <br><br>
            Here is an example:

            Acceleration time graphs
            <br><br>
        </h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            For an <b>acceleration - time</b> graph, the area under the graph from the start until a certain
            time represents the velocity at that time.
            <br><br>
            This means that when acceleration is <b>negative</b>, velocity is <b>not necessarily</b> negative, it is just decreasing.
            <br><br>
            Here is an example:
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <video src="..\assets\atgraph.mp4" class="animations" autoplay loop muted></video>
        <p class="explanation">
            In this situation, the area under the <b>positive</b> part and <b>negative</b> part are <b>equal</b>.
            <br>
            Thus, the velocity at the end would be equal to <b>0 m/s</b> as the areas - which represent the velocity - cancel out.

        <h2 class="section-title">Equations of Motion</h2>
        <p class="equations-text">The equations of motion describe the relationship between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time for uniformly accelerated motion. The three main equations are:</p>
        <ul class="equations-list">
            <li>v = u + at</li>
            <li>s = 0.5(v+u)t</li>

        <h1 class="section-title">Derivation of Equations of Motion</h1>
        <p class="explanation">  
            They can be derived from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, along with the assumption of constant acceleration. For example, the first equation (v = u + at) comes directly from the definition of acceleration as the change in velocity over time. The second and third equations can be derived by integrating the acceleration and velocity equations.
        </p>
        <video class="animations" src="..\assets\SUVAT_derivation.mp4" alt="Equation Derivation" autoplay loop muted></video>
        <h1 class="section-title">Further Insight</h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            As you saw in the animation, these equations all assume that acceleration is constant. The point of showing the derivation of these equations is to give a deeper understanding and insight into this topic, as that is vital to being able to solve the questions given in the exams. Physics is not about memorizing, but about understanding
            <br><br>
            Another - more mathematical - way to derive these equations is to use integration:
        </p>
        \[
        \int_{}^{} ( v ) dt  =  \int_{}^{} ( u + at )  dt
        \]
        <p class="explanation">
            First, we integrate both sides of the original velocity - time graph equation with respect to '<b>t</b>' and use the <b>POWER RULE</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>Remember</b> to treat any other variable except 't' as a <b><i>constant</i></b>
        </p>
        \[
        \frac{vt^{0+1}}{0+1}  =  \frac{ut^{0+1}}{0+1}  +  \frac{at^{1+1}}{1+1}
        \]
        \[
        vt  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p class="explanation">
            However, we still dont have our 's' component equal to our equation...
        </p>
        \[
        v  =  \frac {s}{t}
        \]
        \[
        s  =  v t
        \]
        <p><i>Thus:</i></p>
        \[
        vt  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p><i>Can be written as:</i></p>
        \[
        s  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p class="explanation">Now we can work out the other SUVAT equations using the same substitution method shown in the animation.</p>

        <h1 class="main-title">Projectile motion</h1>
        <p class="explanation">To understand projectile motion, you first need to understand the nature of 
            vector quantities and how they can be broken up into vertical and horizontal components
        </p>
        <image src="..\assets\velocitycomponents.png" class="example"></image>
        <p class="explanation">As a ball is moving at an angle, it is moving forward a certain velocity and upwards a certain velocity. We can calculate
            these velocity components using our SohCahToa rules as   \(V_{y}\)   and   \(V_{x}\)   are perpendicular.
            <br>
            Thus, we can write \(V_{y}\)   and   \(V_{x}\) as:
            \[
            V_{y} = V \cdot sin(\theta)
            \]
            \[
            V_{x} = V \cdot cos(\theta)
            \]
            where \(\theta\) is the <b>angle</b> the ball is thrown at
            <br>
            <p>Now lets do a question (<b>remember</b>, this concept applies to all vector quantities, such as force, momentum etc.)</p>
        </p>
        <image src="..\assets\componentsquestion.png" class="question"></image>
        <p class="explanation">
            First, let us find the weight of the trolley...<br><br>
            we know that:
            \[
            W = m \cdot g
            \]
            Thus
            \[
            W = 0.2 \cdot 9.81
            \newline
            W = 1.962 N
            \newline
            \newline
            V = W
            \newline
            V = [1.962 N]
            \]
            Now let us use the formula from before (remember, we are trying to find the component of the weight along the slope, which is the vertical component in the diagram):
            <image src="..\assets\DiagramCompQuestion.png" class="question"></image>
            \[
            V_{y} = V \cdot sin(\theta)
            \newline
            \theta = 1.8^{\circ}
            \newline
            v_{y} = 1.962 \cdot sin(1.8)^{\circ}
            \newline
            v_{y} = 0.0616_{3.s.f}
            \newline
            \newline
            [0.0616 N \approx 0.06 N]

            \]
            <br><br>
            Now lets look at a projectile motion question:
            <br>
            
        </p>
        <image src="..\assets\projectilequestion1.png" class="question"></image>
        <p class="explanation">
            In this question, we are given the height the ball was thrown from, the distance between the cannon and the ship, and the initial vertical velocity (which is 0 as it is shot at horizontally)
            <br>
            Out of the 2 distances given, the one we will use is the vertical one, we choose this one as acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2) 
            acts downwards, which causes the ball to touch the floor. Now, we can use the SUVAT equations we derived previously (to choose which
            equation to use, you compare what values you are given and what you have to find with the equations provided on the sheet, then choose accordingly).
            <br>
            Thus:
            \[
            s_{y}=u_{y}t + \frac{1}{2} a_{y} t^{2}
            \newline
            \newline
            s_{y} = 67
            \newline
            u_{y} = 0
            \newline
            a_{y} = 9.81
            \newline
            \newline
            67 = 0 \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.81 t^{2}
            \newline
            \newline
            67 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.81 t^{2}
            \newline
            \newline
            rearrange
            \newline
            \newline
            t^{2} = \frac{2 \cdot 67}{9.81}
            \newline
            t^{2} = 13.66_{2.d.p}
            \newline
            t = 3.696 s
            \newline
            \newline
            [3.696 s \approx 3.7 s]
            \]
        </p>
        <image src="..\assets\projectileq1ii.png" class="question"></image>
        <p class="explanation">
            For this question, we need to use the <b>t</b> value we calculater previously. As we know the distance to the ship and the time it takes to reach it,
            we can use the v=s/t equation to work out its initial horizontal velocity (constant)
            \[
            V_{x} = \frac{S_{x}}{t}
            \newline
            \newline
            V_{x} = \frac{150}{3.696}
            \newline
            \newline
            V_{x} = [40.6ms^{-1}]_{3.s.f}
            \]

        <image src="..\assets\projectileq1iii.png" class="explanation"></image>
        <p class="explanation">
            Now, we can use the value of t and the acceleration equation to find out the vertical component of velocity just before the ball hits the ship (which is t = 3.696)
            \[
            a_{y} = \frac{v_{y} - u_{y}}{t}
            \newline
            v_{y} = a_{y}\cdot t + u_{y}
            \newline
            \newline
            a_{y} = 9.81 \>\>\>
            u_{y} = 0 \>\>\>
            t = 3.696
            \newline
            \newline
            v_{y} = 9.81 \cdot 3.696 + 0
            \newline
            v_{y} = [36.3 ms^{-1}]_{3.s.f}
            \]
        </p>
        <image src="..\assets\projectileq1iv.png" class="question"></image>
        <p class="explanation">
            To do this question, we use our answer from part (ii.) and (iii.) and apply our knowledge of vector components.
            <br>
            <br>
            First we need to find the magnitude of the force, which is simple as we use pythagoras' theorem:
            \[
            V^{2} = v_{y}^{2} + v_{x}^{2}
            \]
            as the question explicitly states <b>just before it hits the ship</b>, our \(v_{y}\) and \(v_{x}\) are:
            \[
            v_{y} = 36.3
            \newline
            \newline
            v_{x} = 40.6
            \newline
            \newline
            Thus:
            \newline
            \newline
            V = \sqrt{36.3^{2} + 40.6^{2}}
            \newline
            \newline
            V = [54.5 ms^{-1}]_{3.s.f}
            \]
            Now, we need find the direction, which is the angle at which it is travelling during that time. 
            <br>
            To calculate this, we will use SohCahToa
            \[
            tan(\theta) = \frac{OPP}{ADJ}
            \newline
            \newline
            tan(\theta) = \frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}
            \newline
            \newline
            tan(\theta) = \frac{36.3}{40.6}
            \newline
            \newline
            \theta = arctan(\frac{36.3}{40.6})
            \newline
            \newline
            \theta = [41.8^{\circ}]_{3.s.f}
            \]
            As you can see, projectile motion is nothing more than applying your knowledge on SUVAT equations and vectors, there is nothing <i>new</i>.
