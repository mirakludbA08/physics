        <h1 class="main-title">Motion</h1>
        <p class="IntroductionText">Motion is the change in position of an object over time. It can be described in terms of displacement, distance, speed, velocity, and acceleration. Understanding motion is fundamental to the study of physics as it helps explain how objects interact with forces and energy.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Key Concepts in Motion</h2>
        <ul class="key-concepts">
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the change in position of an object. It has both magnitude and direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> A scalar quantity that refers to how much ground an object has covered during its motion.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> A scalar quantity that refers to how fast an object is moving. It is calculated as distance divided by time (s = d/t).</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object changes its position. It is calculated as displacement divided by time (v = Δx/Δt).</li>
            <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. It is calculated as change in velocity divided by time (a = Δv/Δt).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="section-title">Equations of Motion</h2>
        <p class="equations-text">The equations of motion describe the relationship between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time for uniformly accelerated motion. The three main equations are:</p>
        <ul class="equations-list">
            <li>v = u + at</li>
            <li>s = 0.5(v+u)t</li>
            <li>s = ut + 0.5at²</li>
            <li>v² = u² + 2as</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="equations-explanation">Where:
            <ul>
                <li>v = final velocity (m/s)</li>
                <li>u = initial velocity (m/s)</li>
                <li>a = acceleration (m/s²)</li>
                <li>s = displacement (m)</li>
                <li>t = time (s)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1 class="section-title">Derivation of Equations of Motion</h1>
        <p class="intuition">  
            They can be derived from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, along with the assumption of constant acceleration. For example, the first equation (v = u + at) comes directly from the definition of acceleration as the change in velocity over time. The second and third equations can be derived by integrating the acceleration and velocity equations.

        <h1 class="section-title">Further Insight</h1>
        <p class="intuition">
            As you saw in the animation, these equations all assume that acceleration is constant. The point of showing the derivation of these equations is to give a deeper understanding and insight into this topic, as that is vital to being able to solve the questions given in the exams. Physics is not about memorizing, but about understanding
            <br><br>
            Another - more mathematical - way to derive these equations is to use integration:
        </p>
        \[
        \int_{}^{} ( v ) dt  =  \int_{}^{} ( u + at )  dt
        \]
        <p class="intuition">
            First, we integrate both sides of the original velocity - time graph equation with respect to '<b>t</b>' and use the <b>POWER RULE</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>Remember</b> to treat any other variable except 't' as a <b><i>constant</i></b>
        </p>
        \[
        \frac{vt^{0+1}}{0+1}  =  \frac{ut^{0+1}}{0+1}  +  \frac{at^{1+1}}{1+1}
        \]
        \[
        vt  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p class="intuition">
            However, we still dont have our 's' component equal to our equation...
        </p>
        \[
        v  =  \frac {s}{t}
        \]
        \[
        s  =  v t
        \]
        <p><i>Thus:</i></p>
        \[
        vt  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p><i>Can be written as:</i></p>
        \[
        s  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p class="intuition">Now we can work out the other SUVAT equations using the same method shown in the animation.</p>
