        <h1 class="main-title">Motion</h1>
        <p class="IntroductionText">Motion is the change in position of an object over time. It can be described in terms of displacement, distance, speed, velocity, and acceleration. Understanding motion is fundamental to the study of physics as it helps explain how objects interact with forces and energy.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Key Concepts in Motion</h2>
        <ul class="key-concepts">
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the change in position of an object. It has both magnitude and direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> A scalar quantity that refers to how much ground an object has covered during its motion.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> A scalar quantity that refers to how fast an object is moving. It is calculated as distance divided by time (s = d/t).</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object changes its position. It is calculated as displacement divided by time (v = Δx/Δt).</li>
            <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> A vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. It is calculated as change in velocity divided by time (a = Δv/Δt).<br><br></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="section-title">Interpreting displacement-time, velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs</h2>

        <video src="..\assets\S_Tgraphs.mp4" class="animations" autoplay loop muted></video>
        
        <p class="explanation">
            As you can see, when displacement is increasing at a constant rate, where displacement is directly proportional to time, the velocity is constant.
            <br><br>
            This shows that obtaining the velocity graph from a displacement graph is just <b>diffrentiating</b> the function used to graph displacement
            <br><br>
            Just in case it is not clear yet,<br>lets suppose this is the equation for displacement:
            
            \[
            s  =  10t
            \]
            \[ 
            \frac {ds} {dt}  =  \frac {ds} {dt} \cdot (10t)
            \] 
            \[ 
            \frac {ds} {dt} \cdot (10t)  =  10
            \]
            \[
            \frac {ds} {dt}  =  v
            \]
            <p class="explanation">
                Thus:
            </p>
            \[
            v  =  10
            \]

        <p class="explanation">

            This example shows a parabolic s - t graph.<br><br>If we apply the same logic to this situation, we obtain a linear graph;
            this makes sense as our gradient (which represents the velocity at that point) is increasing at a linear rate, 
            which also means our velocity is increasing linearly.

        <p class="explanation">

            In this example, the gradient starts off steep, but slowly levels off to a gradient of 0.

            Velocity time graphs
            <br><br>
        </h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            Velocity - time graphs have velocity on the <b>y - axis</b> and time on the <b>x - axis</b>. In this situation, the gradient 
            of the graph at a point <b>represents the acceleration</b> of the object. 
            <br><br>
            The <b>Area</b> under the graph until a certain point represents the <b>distance</b> that object moves.
            <br><br>
            Here is an example:
            <br><br>

            Acceleration time graphs
            <br><br>
        </h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            For an <b>acceleration - time</b> graph, the area under the graph from the start until a certain
            time represents the velocity at that time.
            <br><br>
            This means that when acceleration is <b>negative</b>, velocity is <b>not necessarily</b> negative, it is just decreasing.
            <br><br>
            Here is an example:
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <video src="..\assets\atgraph.mp4" class="animations" autoplay loop muted></video>
        <p class="explanation">
            In this situation, the area under the <b>positive</b> part and <b>negative</b> part are <b>equal</b>.
            <br>
            Thus, the velocity at the end would be equal to <b>0 m/s</b> as the areas - which represent the velocity - cancel out.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Equations of Motion</h2>
        <p class="equations-text">The equations of motion describe the relationship between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time for uniformly accelerated motion. The three main equations are:</p>
        <ul class="equations-list">
            <li>v = u + at</li>
            <li>s = 0.5(v+u)t</li>
            <li>s = ut + 0.5at²</li>
            <li>v² = u² + 2as</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="equations-explanation">Where:
            <ul>
                <li>v = final velocity (m/s)</li>
                <li>u = initial velocity (m/s)</li>
                <li>a = acceleration (m/s²)</li>
                <li>s = displacement (m)</li>
                <li>t = time (s)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1 class="section-title">Derivation of Equations of Motion</h1>
        <p class="explanation">  
            They can be derived from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, along with the assumption of constant acceleration. For example, the first equation (v = u + at) comes directly from the definition of acceleration as the change in velocity over time. The second and third equations can be derived by integrating the acceleration and velocity equations.
        </p>
        <video class="animations" src="..\assets\SUVAT_derivation.mp4" alt="Equation Derivation" autoplay loop muted></video>
        <h1 class="section-title">Further Insight</h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            As you saw in the animation, these equations all assume that acceleration is constant. The point of showing the derivation of these equations is to give a deeper understanding and insight into this topic, as that is vital to being able to solve the questions given in the exams. Physics is not about memorizing, but about understanding
            <br><br>
            Another - more mathematical - way to derive these equations is to use integration:
        </p>
        \[
        \int_{}^{} ( v ) dt  =  \int_{}^{} ( u + at )  dt
        \]
        <p class="explanation">
            First, we integrate both sides of the original velocity - time graph equation with respect to '<b>t</b>' and use the <b>POWER RULE</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>Remember</b> to treat any other variable except 't' as a <b><i>constant</i></b>
        </p>
        \[
        \frac{vt^{0+1}}{0+1}  =  \frac{ut^{0+1}}{0+1}  +  \frac{at^{1+1}}{1+1}
        \]
        \[
        vt  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p class="explanation">
            However, we still dont have our 's' component equal to our equation...
        </p>
        \[
        v  =  \frac {s}{t}
        \]
        \[
        s  =  v t
        \]
        <p><i>Thus:</i></p>
        \[
        vt  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p><i>Can be written as:</i></p>
        \[
        s  =  ut  +  0.5 a t^2
        \]
        <p class="explanation">Now we can work out the other SUVAT equations using the same substitution method shown in the animation.</p>
